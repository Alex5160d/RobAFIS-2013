RobAFIS-2013
============

Full code used during the RobAFIS contest of 2013.

[Robos'πR](https://raw.github.com/Alex5160d/RobAFIS-2013/pictures/robotspir.jpg)

### What's it all about?

Wrote in [Robotc] [1], this is the code of Robos'πR, the little Lego robot we built for the RobAFIS contest.

You can build your own robot using this technical paper: [scribd technical paper] [2]
However this code is intended as an exemple of what can be done with Robotc and the robot itself is of less importance here.

### What can you find in it?

Among other things, you'll find:
* A fast line tracker with two light/color sensors
* Lot of multitasking (usefull in this case)
* An example of color detection avoiding mistakes
* A way to use `hogCPU()`
* A way to use the file management in Robotc
* Last but not least, the mario music played by the NXT \o/

### Why would you use it?

Because Lego is fun \o/
